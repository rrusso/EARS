<p>
Cross listing courses allows you to combine the courses from the different
departments you teach into a single or multiple Moodle course, or <strong><a href="#terminology_courseshell">course shell</a></strong>.  This benefits those
who need to manage their students and course materials in a single course as the
cross listed courses are essentially the same under different departments.
Students enrolled in a cross listed course will also be able to communicate and
participate with students from other sections.
</p>
<p>
Though cross listing your courses together has many benefits, it is inevitable
that some individuals will want to undo their cross listings.  Don't worry as it
is possible to remove the cross listing between courses and have them revert
back to their original Moodle courses.

You apply a cross list preference when two or more courses combine their sections into one or more course shell.

A course shell is a Moodle course created from sections of a pre-cross listed course. For an in-depth explanation, 
see (<strong><a href="help.php?module=block_courseprefs&amp;file=split.html#terminology_courseshell">course shell</a></strong>).
A cross list course shell rules are slightly different: you are allowed to have one, should you so desire.

<h2><a name="restrictions">Restrictions</a></h2>
<p>
Before we get into the details of how to cross list your courses, there are some
restrictions on how courses can be cross listed that must be explained.
</p>
<h3><a name="restrictions_instructorprimary">Only primary instructors of sections can cross list them</a></h3>
<p>
As cross listing a course is an important decision, the only primary instructors can cross list them.
</p>
<a href="#top">Return to the top</a>
<h3><a name="restrictions_semestersame">Only sections from the same semester can be cross listed</a></h3>
<p>
As Moodle will have course and student information from different semesters
available to instructors, only sections from the same semester can be cross
listed. Additionally, you have to be teaching at least two courses from the same semester.
