<h1><a name="top">How to set default split preferences</a></h1>
<p>
In order to set default split preferences, you will be working with the &quot;Default Settings&quot; section of the page as in the picture below:
</p>
<img src="<?php echo $CFG->wwwroot; ?>/blocks/courseprefs/images/split_default01.gif" alt="Screenshot showing default split preferences form" />
<p>
The default preferences consist of a single form field: whether all courses should be split into individual Moodle courses.  By setting this preference to &quot;Yes&quot;, all current and future courses will be separated Moodle courses. 
</p>
<p>
Once the page reloads after updating the default preferences, a message should appear stating that your changes were saved.  Default preferences will take effect within an hour of being updated.  Students and instructors will be unenrolled from any existing Moodle courses and enrolled into their newly created Moodle courses separated from other sections.
