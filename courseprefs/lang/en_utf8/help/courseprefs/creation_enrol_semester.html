<p>
The semester preferences consist multiple courses that you are teaching with fields for the number of days before classes to create Moodle course and to enroll students as illustrated in the picture below.  These preferences override the default preferences solely for the courses in the semesters they are set.  The <a href="help.php?module=block_courseprefs&amp;file=creation_enrol.html#restrictions">same restrictions</a> apply to semester preferences as they do default preferences: courses must be created before students are enrolled.

Once the page reloads after updating the semester preferences, a message should appear stating that your changes were saved.  Semester preferences will take effect within an hour of being updated.
