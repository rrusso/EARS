<h1><a name="top">Removing cross listing from courses</a></h1>
<p>
In order to remove cross listing from courses and have them separate into their individual Moodle courses, you will be working with the &quot;Remove cross listing from existing courses&quot; section of the page as in the picture below:
</p>
<img src="<?php echo $CFG->wwwroot; ?>/blocks/courseprefs/images/crosslist_add02.gif" alt="Screenshot showing result of cross listing multiple secondary sections with the same primary section" />
<p>
Select the cross listings you desire to remove by clicking their checkboxes and clicking the "Remove" button below.  Once the page reloads, a message should appear stating that your changes were saved and the selected sections should not appear in the listing of current cross listed courses.
</p>
<p>
Courses that have been removed from their previous cross listings will be processed within an hour of being requested.  All students and instructors will be unenrolled from the cross listed Moodle course and enrolled into the separate Moodle courses accordingly.
