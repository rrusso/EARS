<h1><a name="top">Default creation and enrollment preferences</a></h1>
<p>
The default preferences consists of the number of days before classes to create Moodle course and to enroll students.  
These preferences are used whenever courses do not have semester preferences set.  Courses are created 30 days before
start of classes and students are enrolled 14 days before start of classes by default.  
</p>

<p>
The rest of the settings can be set manually after a course has been created through Administration->Settings with the exception of Delete option. Each preference will
be presented below with it's default.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Format</strong>: Weekly (see <a href="help.php?module=moodle&amp;file=courseformats.html">Format</a>)</li>

    <li><strong>Availability</strong>: This course is not available to students (see <a href="help.php?module=moodle&amp;file=courseavailability.html">Availability</a>)</li>
</ul>
