<h1><a name="top">How to create materials courses</a></h1>
<p>
In order to create materials courses, you will be working with the &quot;Create materials courses&quot; section of the page as in the picture below.  As you can see, only courses you are currently teaching will be available to select from.  If a course does not appear in the list, then it is unable to have a materials course created for it whether due to an existing materials course or another issue.

<p>
Begin by selecting the courses you want materials courses created for and click the &quot;Save changes&quot; button.  Once the page reloads, a message should appear stating that your changes were saved and the courses you requested materials courses created will be selected.  Materials course requests will be processed within an hour of being requested.  Once the materials courses have been created, you will not be able to delete them; only an administrator can.
