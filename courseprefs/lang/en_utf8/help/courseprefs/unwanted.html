<p>
Marking courses as unwanted allows you to prevent them from being created in Moodle.  This benefits those who do not want to confuse their students into thinking the Moodle course will be used by the instructor to teach his/her course.  If your course has already been created in Moodle, then marking it as unwanted will unenroll all students and instructors including yourself; the Moodle course will be unavailable until you decide to teach it in Moodle.  Unwanted course preferences will be processed within an hour of being requested.

<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: If you have the default delete option set in <a href="help.php?module=block_courseprefs&amp;file=creation_enrol.html#terminology_deletepreference">Course Creation and Enrollment</a>, then the course will be deleted when enrollment is zero, or more precisely, when an entire course is unwanted.
</p>

<p>
As can be seen in the picture below, you have the ability to decide whether you want all or specific sections of a course to be taught in Moodle.  Your unwanted preferences are organized around courses with an entry use to mark all sections within the course.
