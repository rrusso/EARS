<h1><a name="top">Revoking team teaching invitations</a></h1>
<p>
Whether it is due to an invited instructor taking too long to accept or reject an invitation or a mistake in sending a team teaching invitation, it is easy to revoke an invitation.  You will be working with the &quot;Revoke team teaching invitations&quot; section of the page.  If there are no pending invitations or previously accepted invitations, then it will look like the picture below:
</p>

If you have any pending or previously accepted invitations, then it will look like the picture below:
</p>
<img src="<?php echo $CFG->wwwroot; ?>/blocks/courseprefs/images/teamteach_remove02.gif" alt="Screenshot showing invitations to revoke" />
<p>
Select the invitations you desire to remove by clicking their checkboxes and clicking the "Remove" button below.  Once the page reloads, a message should appear stating emails have been sent to the instructors of the sections your revoked that looks like the following:
</p>

Sections selected revoked will be processed within an hour of the invitation being revoked.  All invited students and instructors will be unenrolled from the instructor's Moodle course.
