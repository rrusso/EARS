<p>
In order to set course-specific split preferences, you would select a course from your pool of splittable courses:

<p>
Once you have selected a course that you wish to split, proceed to the next screen where you decide how many 
<strong><a href="help.php?module=block_courseprefs&amp;file=split.html#terminology_courseshell">course shells</a></strong> to make out of the course.
The default number of course shells is the number of sections within the course. If you want a course with the default settings, then the preference will
be immediately applied. However, If the number you have chosen is less than the default number, then you will be brought to the next screen:
</p>

<p>
In this screen, you move the sections into the desired course shell. It is recommended to customize the name of the shells in question. In my example,
I moved half my sections to one shell and named it <strong>MWF</strong> and other half to a shell I named <strong>TTH</strong>.

<p>
Once submitted, you will be returned to first split page. You will notice that a split option was taken on the course in question. If you need to 
undo the split setting, or change the sections within, select the course with the split option, and click &quot;Next&quot;.

If the sections were not split to your liking, you can rinse and repeat here.
