<h1><a name="top">How to cross list courses</a></h1>
<p>
In order to cross list courses within one another into a single Moodle course, you must select at least two courses from your pool like the picture below:

<p>
Once you have selected the course to cross list together, you must select the number of course shells to create. The default is one course shell.

<p>
The next screen then allows to you to move sections freely in the appropriate course shell. A name will be generated for the course shell, but if you
have more than one shell, it is highly recommended to give the shells meaningful names.

<p>
Once you are satisfied with your changes, submit them, and your new course will be created. If you need to reset your cross list settings, or change the current ones,
the process is simple. Select the cross listed courses, and press &quot;Next&quot;.

<p>
At this screen, you can reset the courses, or return sections back into the pool of sections. You can even add another shell, if the number of sections allow it.

<strong>Note</strong>: If you have the default delete option set in <a href="help.php?module=block_courseprefs&amp;file=creation_enrol.html#terminology_deletepreference">Course Creation and Enrollment</a>, then the <strong>pre-cross listed</strong> course will be deleted when enrollment is zero, or more precisely, when all the sections from a course are moved into a course shell or course shells.
