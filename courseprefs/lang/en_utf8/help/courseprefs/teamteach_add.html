<p>
Begin by selecting the section you wish to team teach.  Next, enter the department, course number, and section number of the section you want to send the team teaching invitation to and click the &quot;Add Entry&quot; button.  As noted in the general team teaching help, there are <a href="help.php?module=block_courseprefs&amp;file=teamteach.html#restrictions">several restrictions related to sending a team teaching invitation</a>.
</p>
<p>
Once the page reloads, a message should appear stating that an email has been sent to the instructor of the section you wish to team teach.  Beneath the &quot;Send a team teaching invitation&quot;, the team teaching invitation you just sent will appear in the list of pending invitations and invitations you may revoke as in the picture below:
</p>

<p>
Until the invited instructor accepts or rejects your invitation, it will be listed under the pending invitations.  The invited instructor will receive an email shortly and will look like the following:
