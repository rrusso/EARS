<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
Splitting courses allows you to have the sections of a course you teach separated into individual Moodle courses, or <strong><a href="#terminology_courseshell">course shells</a></strong>.  
This benefits those who want to customized content for each section and isolate the students from the different sections.  
This is achieved by applying a split <strong><a href="#terminology_coursepreference">course preference</a></strong> on the desired course. Though splitting your courses has 
many benefits, it is inevitable that some individuals will want to undo these preferences.  Do not worry as it is possible to combine 
the separate sections of a course into their original Moodle course.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: If you have the default delete option set in <a href="help.php?module=block_courseprefs&amp;file=creation_enrol.html#terminology_deletepreference">Course Creation and Enrollment</a>, then the <strong>pre-split</strong> course will be deleted when enrollment is zero, or more precisely, when a split option is taken.

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="terminology_coursepreference">course preference</a></strong></dt>
<dd>
Preferences set for specific courses stating all sections of the selected course be split into individual Moodle courses.
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="terminology_courseshell">course shell</a></strong></dt>
<dd>
A course shell describes a Moodle course created during splitting or <a href="help.php?module=block_courseprefs&amp;file=crosslist.html">cross listing</a>. 
For example: In a pre-split course with <i>n</i> sections, where <i>n</i> is greater than 1, there is a possibility for 2 to <i>n</i> course shells to be created from the original course.

<h2><a name="restrictions">Restrictions</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>You must have more than one section in a course.</strong></dt>
<dd>The split option only makes sense when you have multiple section under the same course number.</dd>
<dt><strong>No other preference must be applied to the course.</strong></dt>
<dd>This applies to every preference! Once you have applied any preference (Split, Crosslist, Teamteach), you must revert the course to it's original state before applying a different preference.</dd>
