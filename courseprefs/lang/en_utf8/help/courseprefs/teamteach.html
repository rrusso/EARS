<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
Team teaching courses allows you to enroll students and instructors from other courses into a section you are teaching.  This benefits those who want to team up with instructors teaching the same course or a completely different course especially interdisciplinary classes.  Unlike cross listing courses, team teaching only enrolls students and instructors from multiple Moodle courses into a single course rather than consolidating them in a single Moodle course.
</p>
<p>
As team teaching should not be taken lightly, instructors extend <a href="#terminology_teamteachinginvitation">team teaching invitations</a> to others to team teach their sections with another.  These invitations can be either accepted or rejected as the receiving instructor desires.  Though team teaming your courses with other instructors has many benefits, it is inevitable that some individuals will want to undo their team teachings.  Don't worry as it is possible to remove the team teachings between courses and have students and instructors unenrolled properly.
