</p>
<p>Once a sport is selected, the admin can search for the user to be assigned to that
particular sport. A mentor can be assigned to no sports, meaning that the administrator
wants this mentor to be assigned to a specific person or people.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> see <a href="help.php?module=block_student_gradeviewer&amp;file=admin_page_person.html">Assigning students to mentors</a> if the 
admin wants to assign specific people to ASCA mentors of any kind.</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> the admin can alias the sports code as a human readable name, if he so desires. 
See <a href="help.php?module=block_student_gradeviewer&amp;file=admin_page_name.html">Changing the sports name</a> for
more details.
