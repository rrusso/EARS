<h1>CAS Administration</h1>
<p>First, the admin has to define what the CAS mentor is capable of viewing. The admin
is capable of assign mentors years a student has been enrolled, the college, or specific
major, or a culmination of all three, ie: <strong>Year 2</strong> students in the 
college of <strong>BASC</strong> majoring in <strong>BIOL</strong> (fig. 1), or just students in the
college of <strong>BASC</strong> (fig. 2).</p>

</p>
<p>Don't worry about knowing the college and 
major codes in LSU, because the form will autocomplete based on your input.</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> leaving any field blank simply means that that field is not required to look up anything. 
Leaving every field blank means that you are assigning mentors to people instead of a field. See
<a href="help.php?module=block_student_gradeviewer&amp;file=admin_page_person.html">Assigning mentors to students
</a> for information.
