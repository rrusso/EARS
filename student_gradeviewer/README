*    Installation Notes    *
****************************

In order for your system to use the student_gradeviewer block,
some dependencies must be taken care of first.

1. Make sure the courseprefs block is installed. This block requires
tables from that block, so it should be present in your system.

2. Install the gradeviewer block.

3. Create admin roles for CAS and ACSA administration and mentors, so 4
roles to be created in total. Admins should have both admin and view grades, 
and mentors should be configured to only see the grades of their category, ie:
regular mentors can view grades, whereas sport mentors can only view grades
of sport students.

4. Navigate to the blocks admin settings, and map the roles to the created
Moodle roles.

5. Make sure the data is populated correctly: Sport codes and relationships,
year, college, and majors for students.

You're ready to begin.
